# specific todos
# nn optimizer / param groups?
# check nn module (for simplification?)
# new model/training/testing scheme -> make it more modularized
# Conf's init: what types
# dropout setting: use training/testing(with/wo)-mode
# easy-to-use calculations result-representing tools for analysis
# various tools for python as the replacement of direct bash shell
# gru and cnn have problems?
# ----
# -- Next Version principles and goals:
# nlp data types & unified data formats!!
# model and submodules and ... (composition or inheritance??) !!
# more flexible namings: model/module name, loss name, data-field names, ...
# use type hint
# checkings and reportings
# use eval for Conf
# io and serialization
# summarize more common patterns, including those in scripts
# everything has (more flexible) conf
# more flexible save/load for part of model; (better naming and support dynamic adding and deleting components!!)
# a small one: more flexible path finder, for example, multiple upper layers of ".."

# basic principles
# 0. shared pattern: make it re-usable
# 1. lazy eval: calc as need & with cache
# 2. cpp style: maybe transfer to other lang (c++) in the future
# 3. search oriented: focus should be at the searching part
# 4. others: avoid-early-opt, checking&snapshot, clear-code&locality, table-driven&oo
# !!: (renewed) composition rather than inheritance, that is, some useful pieces rather than a framework
# !!: (again-corrected) The goal is not to build a whole framework, but several useful pieces.

# conventions
# todo(0)/todo(warn)/todo(note): simply warning or noting
# todo(+N): need what level of efforts, +N means lots of efforts
# TODO: unfinished, real todo

# hierarchically: msp -> scripts / tasks, no reverse ref allowed!
